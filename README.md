# 🌟 My Hero – Tribute Webpage

A personal HTML webpage created to honor and celebrate the life of my father. This project blends storytelling, music, and family photos into a heartfelt digital tribute. It also reflects my growing skills in web development, GitHub organization, and project presentation as part of my Computing and IT degree.

## 🧠 Motivation

This project is more than code—it's a reflection of love, memory, and growth. It allowed me to combine technical learning with personal storytelling, and to create something meaningful while practicing HTML, CSS, and GitHub workflows.
