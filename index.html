      <h2>1. His legacy</h2>
      <p>My father's enduring legacy is a simple yet profound guide: prioritize kindness, embrace forgiveness, and seize every moment of life.</p>
      <p>He consistently found the good in bad situations. For him, the simple things in life held more significance than grand acts.</p>
      <p>His love and respect for nature, and his faith in its healing, have also become part of who I am.</p>

      <h2>2. Childhood memories</h2>
      <p>Growing up, my best times were with my dad. He was so creative; he'd build me absolutely anything.</p>
      <p>I also loved his stories, the kind that were just ours, locked in my memory.</p>
      <p>I really want to keep those stories going and tell them to my children.</p>
      <p>Music was a big thing growing up too. And yeah, we always had tons of animals around – like, every kind you could think of. Mostly they were rescues.</p>

    <section id="trips">
      <h2>3. Trips around the world</h2>
      <p>In the year before we lost him, my dad and mom got to enjoy a few trips with us. He was like a child again, utterly amazed by everything he saw.</p>
      <p>His happiness was so clear, and he couldn't wait to tell everyone about it.</p>
      <p>Knowing his difficult start in life and how hard he had to work from such a young age, seeing all those different places and cultures must have been truly special for him.</p>
      <p>I'm just so glad we could give him those moments as his time with us was drawing to an end...</p>

    <section id="music">
      <h2>4. Importance of music</h2>
      <p>Music is how I feel my dad's enduring presence. He got me started on instruments, and singing was always his way of really expressing himself.</p>
      <p>That dodgy sense of rhythm I've got? Yep, that's from my father – something we were both hilariously bad at.</p>
      <p>My playlists are packed with his favorites: <strong>The Beatles, Creedence Clearwater Revival, and Dire Straits</strong>. <em>"Have You Ever Seen the Rain"</em> was a huge one for him, and the very last song he heard.</p>
      <p><em>This video captures some of our joyful moments together, both playing and creating precious memories. His favorite song, played by me, forms the soundtrack to these moments.</em></p>
